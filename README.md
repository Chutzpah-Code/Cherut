## 📅 Development Timeline & MVP Strategy

### MVP Strategy: Bootstrap Approach

**Philosophy**: Start with $0, validate with Core plan, scale with revenue.

**Phase 1: MVP - Core Plan Only (Weeks 1-12)**

| Week | Focus | Deliverables | Cost |
|------|-------|--------------|------|
| **1-2** | Foundation | Monorepo setup, Firebase config, Stripe setup | $0 |
| **3-4** | Auth & Landing | Landing page with pricing, Stripe checkout, Firebase Auth | $0 |
| **5-8** | Core Modules | Life Areas, Goals, Habits, Tasks, Vision Board, Reflection, Time Tracker | $0 |
| **9-10** | Polish & Test | Admin dashboard, mobile responsive, basic analytics | $0 |
| **11-12** | Launch | Beta launch (20-50 users), ProductHunt, iterate | $0-7 |

**Total Phase 1 Cost**: $0 (using free tiers)
**Time to Market**: 12 weeks (3 months)
**Target**: 20-50 early adopters at $10/month = $200-500 MRR

**Phase 2: Pro/Master Features (Months 4-12)**

Funded by Core plan revenue ($500-2K/month from 50-200 users):

| Month | Features | Technology | Funded By |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **4-6** | AI Infrastructure | Python/FastAPI microservice, OpenAI API | Core revenue |
| **4-6** | AI Features | Goal suggestions, Habit coaching, AI insights | Core revenue |
| **7-9** | Advanced AI | Predictive AI, Analytics microservice | Core + Pro revenue |
| **7-9** | Integrations | Trello, Google Calendar, Wearables | Core + Pro revenue |
| **10-12** | Elite Features | Adaptive AI Coach, Zapier, Mentorship, Enhanced social cards | All revenue streams |

**Phase 3: Mobile App (Month 13+)**

Funded by existing revenue ($3K-7K/month from 200-500 users):

- Expo mobile app development
- Native iOS/Android features
- App Store submissions
- Push notifications
- Offline sync optimization

### What's In MVP vs What's NOT

**✅ In MVP (Core Plan - Phase 1)**:
- User Profile & Identity (basic)
- Mission Control Dashboard (12 Life Areas with satisfaction tracking)
- Goals & OKRs (up to 5 active with key results)
- Habits (up to 10 active with streak tracking)
- Tasks (up to 50 active with priorities)
- Vision Board (up to 10 items)
- Daily Reflection (mood, energy, gratitude)
- Manual Time Tracker
- Basic analytics (charts, progress tracking)
- Social sharing (basic achievement sharing)
- Stripe payment integration
- Admin + Tester accounts

**❌ NOT in MVP (Phase 2 - Pro/Master)**:
- AI Coach & Suggestions
- Predictive AI & Advanced Analytics
- Smart Time Blocking
- Community features (Cherut Circle)
- Integrations (Trello, Calendar, Wearables)
- Automations (Zapier)
- Enhanced social sharing with branding
- Mentorship system

**Why This Approach?**
1. **$0 Development Cost** - No AI infrastructure = no OpenAI API costs
2. **Faster Validation** - Launch in 3 months vs 6+ months
3. **Revenue-Funded Growth** - Core users fund Pro/Master development
4. **User-Driven Features** - Real feedback shapes AI capabilities
5. **Risk Mitigation** - Validate before investing in complex infrastructure

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ Single codebase for all Core features
- ✅ Decoupled modules with clear boundaries
- ✅ No AI/Analytics infrastructure yet
- ✅ Stripe integration for payments
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Data isolation per user

```

**When to Add Microservices?**
- Revenue justifies costs ($50-100/month for OpenAI API)
- 50+ paying users requesting AI features
- Core plan validated (product-market fit confirmed)
- Team ready to maintain distributed architecture

**Benefits of Phased Approach**:
1. **Cost Efficiency** - Don't pay for unused AI infrastructure
2. **Faster MVP** - No complex microservices setup initially
3. **User Validation** - Build what users actually want
4. **Team Learning** - Master monolith before microservices
5. **Revenue Funding** - Use profits to fund Phase 2
