### Subscription Plans

```typescript
interface Subscription {
  userId: string;
  plan: 'core' | 'pro' | 'master';
  status: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'past_due' | 'trialing';
  stripeCustomerId: string;
  stripeSubscriptionId: string;
  currentPeriodEnd: Date;
  cancelAtPeriodEnd: boolean;
}

// Feature Access by Plan
const features = {
  core: ['basic_modules', 'cloud_sync', 'mobile_app'],
  pro: [...core, 'ai_suggestions', 'analytics', 'integrations', 'community'],
  master: [...pro, 'adaptive_ai', 'predictive_ai', 'automation', 'elite_circle']
};
```

### Entity Relationships & Access Control

**Data Hierarchy Rules:**
- **Life Purpose** → Top-level user definition (editable anytime)
- **Master Goals** → Vision across life areas (editable anytime)
- **Objectives** → Must link to Life Areas (user-configurable cycles)
- **Key Results** → Must link to parent Objective (minimum 3 per objective)
- **Action Plans** → One per Key Result (6 required fields)
- **Tasks (Linked)** → Generated from Action Plans, inherit context from KR and Objective
- **Tasks (Standalone)** → Created independently, can optionally link to Life Area
- **Habits** → Can link to Objectives and Life Areas, or exist independently
- **Subtasks** → Unlimited nesting within any task (parent-child relationships)

**Access Control:**
- **Data Isolation**: Each user sees ONLY their own data
- **Admin Access**: Admin user can view all users, manage system
- **Tester Access**: Test data only, user-level view
- **Paid Access**: Requires active subscription ($10+ minimum)
- **AI features**: Gated by subscription plan (Pro/Master only)
- **Deletion**: Cascades with user confirmation (deleting Objective deletes all KRs, Action Plans, and linked Tasks)

**Flexibility:**
- All entities (Life Purpose, Master Goals, Objectives, KRs, Action Plans, Tasks) are editable anytime
- Objective cycles are user-configurable (default 3 months)
- No hard limits on quantity of Objectives or KRs (minimum 3 KRs per Objective enforced)
- Tasks can exist independently or as part of goal hierarchy

## 🎯 How It All Works: From Life Purpose to Daily Tasks

### The Complete Hierarchy in Action

Cherut uses a **top-down strategic planning approach** that connects your deepest purpose to your daily actions:

**1. Define Your Foundation (One-Time Setup, Always Editable)**

```
Step 1: Life Purpose
"To build products that empower people to reach their full potential"
(One sentence - your "why" for everything)

Step 2: Master Goals (Vision Across Life Areas)
- Health: "Be in peak physical condition, energetic and strong"
- Career: "Lead a successful tech company impacting millions"
- Relationships: "Build deep, meaningful connections with family and friends"
- Finance: "Achieve financial freedom and security"
(Vision of your future self in each life area)
```

**2. Set Strategic Objectives (OKR Methodology)**

```
Objective: "Launch successful SaaS product"
├── Linked to: Career & Purpose (Life Area)
├── Cycle: 3 months (configurable to 1, 6, 12 months, etc.)
└── Status: On Track

Key Result 1: "Reach 500 paying users"
├── Target: 500 users
├── Current: 150 users
└── Progress: 30%

Key Result 2: "Achieve $7,500 MRR"
├── Target: $7,500
├── Current: $2,250
└── Progress: 30%

Key Result 3: "Maintain 95% uptime"
├── Target: 95%
├── Current: 98%
└── Progress: 100% ✓
```

**3. Create Action Plans (Structured Execution)**

```
Action Plan for KR1 ("Reach 500 paying users")

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What    │ Launch ProductHunt campaign          │
│ Why     │ Get visibility and early adopters    │
│ Where   │ ProductHunt, Twitter, LinkedIn       │
│ How     │ Create demo video, launch post       │
│ How Much│ $500 (video production)              │
│ Who     │ Marketing team + CEO                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**4. Generate Tasks (Automatic + Manual)**

From the Action Plan above, tasks are automatically generated:

```
✓ Linked Tasks (from Action Plan)
  ├── "Create demo video script" (Due: Oct 15)
  │   ├── Subtask: "Write script outline"
  │   ├── Subtask: "Record voiceover"
  │   └── Subtask: "Edit final video"
  │
  ├── "Design ProductHunt launch post" (Due: Oct 20)
  │   └── Checklist: [ ] Banner image [ ] Screenshots [ ] Tagline
  │
  └── "Schedule Twitter/LinkedIn promotion" (Due: Oct 22)

✓ Standalone Tasks (created manually)
  ├── "Respond to customer emails" (Recurring: Daily)
  ├── "Review analytics dashboard" (Recurring: Weekly)
  └── "Fix bug #237" (Priority: Urgent)
```

**5. Daily Execution**

Your **Today View** shows:
- Tasks from Action Plans (linked to strategic objectives)
- Standalone tasks (ad-hoc work)
- Recurring tasks
- Habits for the day
- Time blocks for focused work

### Example: Complete User Journey

**Sarah, Startup Founder**

```
Life Purpose: "Build technology that helps people achieve more with less stress"

Master Goal (Career): "Run a profitable SaaS company with 1000+ happy customers"

↓

Objective Q1 2025: "Launch MVP and acquire first 100 paying users"
├── Cycle: 3 months
└── Life Area: Career & Purpose

  ↓

  Key Result 1: "Ship Core plan with all features"
  ├── Action Plan: What/Why/Where/How/How Much/Who
  │   └── Tasks:
  │       ├── "Build landing page" ✓ Done
  │       ├── "Integrate Stripe" → In Progress
  │       └── "Set up Firebase" → To Do

  Key Result 2: "Acquire 100 paying users at $10/month"
  ├── Action Plan: ProductHunt launch strategy
  │   └── Tasks:
  │       ├── "Create demo video" → In Progress
  │       │   ├── Subtask: "Write script" ✓
  │       │   └── Subtask: "Record video" → To Do
  │       └── "Launch on ProductHunt" → To Do

  Key Result 3: "Achieve $1,000 MRR"
  ├── Progress: $250 / $1,000 (25%)
  └── Status: On Track

↓

Daily Tasks (Today View - Oct 29):
├── "Record demo video" (from KR2 Action Plan) [High Priority]
├── "Finish Stripe integration" (from KR1 Action Plan) [High Priority]
├── "Fix login bug" (Standalone task) [Urgent]
├── "Review user feedback" (Standalone, Recurring: Daily)
└── "Morning workout" (Habit: Health & Energy)
```

### Key Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Strategic Alignment**: Every task connects to larger goals and life purpose
✅ **Flexibility**: Can create standalone tasks for ad-hoc work
✅ **Clarity**: See how daily work contributes to quarterly objectives
✅ **Accountability**: Track progress from top (Life Purpose) to bottom (Tasks)
✅ **Adaptability**: Edit any level anytime as priorities change
✅ **Completeness**: Nothing falls through cracks - structured yet flexible

## 📅 Development Timeline & MVP Strategy

### MVP Strategy: Bootstrap Approach

**Philosophy**: Start with $0, validate with Core plan, scale with revenue.

**Phase 1: MVP - Core Plan Only (Weeks 1-12)**

| Week | Focus | Deliverables | Cost |
|------|-------|--------------|------|
| **1-2** | Foundation | Monorepo setup, Firebase config, Stripe setup | $0 |
| **3-4** | Auth & Landing | Landing page with pricing, Stripe checkout, Firebase Auth | $0 |
| **5-8** | Core Modules | Life Areas, Goals, Habits, Tasks, Vision Board, Reflection, Time Tracker | $0 |
| **9-10** | Polish & Test | Admin dashboard, mobile responsive, basic analytics | $0 |
| **11-12** | Launch | Beta launch (20-50 users), ProductHunt, iterate | $0-7 |

**Total Phase 1 Cost**: $0 (using free tiers)
**Time to Market**: 12 weeks (3 months)
**Target**: 20-50 early adopters at $10/month = $200-500 MRR

**Phase 2: Pro/Master Features (Months 4-12)**

Funded by Core plan revenue ($500-2K/month from 50-200 users):

| Month | Features | Technology | Funded By |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **4-6** | AI Infrastructure | Python/FastAPI microservice, OpenAI API | Core revenue |
| **4-6** | AI Features | Goal suggestions, Habit coaching, AI insights | Core revenue |
| **7-9** | Advanced AI | Predictive AI, Analytics microservice | Core + Pro revenue |
| **7-9** | Integrations | Trello, Google Calendar, Wearables | Core + Pro revenue |
| **10-12** | Elite Features | Adaptive AI Coach, Zapier, Mentorship, Enhanced social cards | All revenue streams |

**Phase 3: Mobile App (Month 13+)**

Funded by existing revenue ($3K-7K/month from 200-500 users):

- Expo mobile app development
- Native iOS/Android features
- App Store submissions
- Push notifications
- Offline sync optimization

### What's In MVP vs What's NOT

**✅ In MVP (Core Plan - Phase 1)**:
- User Profile & Identity (basic)
- Mission Control Dashboard (12 Life Areas with satisfaction tracking)
- Goals & OKRs (up to 5 active with key results)
- Habits (up to 10 active with streak tracking)
- Tasks (up to 50 active with priorities)
- Vision Board (up to 10 items)
- Daily Reflection (mood, energy, gratitude)
- Manual Time Tracker
- Basic analytics (charts, progress tracking)
- Social sharing (basic achievement sharing)
- Stripe payment integration
- Admin + Tester accounts

**❌ NOT in MVP (Phase 2 - Pro/Master)**:
- AI Coach & Suggestions
- Predictive AI & Advanced Analytics
- Smart Time Blocking
- Community features (Cherut Circle)
- Integrations (Trello, Calendar, Wearables)
- Automations (Zapier)
- Enhanced social sharing with branding
- Mentorship system

**Why This Approach?**
1. **$0 Development Cost** - No AI infrastructure = no OpenAI API costs
2. **Faster Validation** - Launch in 3 months vs 6+ months
3. **Revenue-Funded Growth** - Core users fund Pro/Master development
4. **User-Driven Features** - Real feedback shapes AI capabilities
5. **Risk Mitigation** - Validate before investing in complex infrastructure

             ├── Community updates
             ├── Email campaigns (Resend)
             └── Push notifications
```

**When to Add Microservices?**
- Revenue justifies costs ($50-100/month for OpenAI API)
- 50+ paying users requesting AI features
- Core plan validated (product-market fit confirmed)
- Team ready to maintain distributed architecture

**Benefits of Phased Approach**:
1. **Cost Efficiency** - Don't pay for unused AI infrastructure
2. **Faster MVP** - No complex microservices setup initially
3. **User Validation** - Build what users actually want
4. **Team Learning** - Master monolith before microservices
5. **Revenue Funding** - Use profits to fund Phase 2
